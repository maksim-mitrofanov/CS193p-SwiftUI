## Lecture Topic
Memorize Game Logic

## Objective
Connect the logic for the memory game to the game UI

* Create the game in the App file
* Pass the game to the ContentView file
* Use ViewModel data to draw ContentView body
* Make View react to changes to the ViewModel (using @StateObject , @ObservableObject, @Published)
* Use optionals to track the faceUpCard index to implement the game logic
* Use protocol conformance (Equatable) to make Generics more concrete (in this case, the card content is still generic, but whatever it is, it must be equatable for the game logic to work)
