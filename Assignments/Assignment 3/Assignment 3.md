#  CS193p-SwiftUI-Assignment 3


## Objective
The objective of Assignment II is to create a solo game of Set from scratch. [Set Game rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)?useskin=vector).

## Required Tasks (short)
- Implement a game of solo (i.e. one player) Set.
- Have room on the screen for all Set cards (81 total).
- Deal 12 cards only to start.
- Add a “Deal 3 More Cards” button.
- Allow the user to select cards to try to match as a Set by touching on the cards.
- Indicate whether selected cards match or mismatch.
- Deselect non-matching cards and select the chosen card when any card is chosen and there are already 3 non-matching Set cards selected.
- Replace 3 matching Set cards with new ones from the deck of 81 Set cards when any card is chosen and there are already 3 matching Set cards selected.
- When the Deal 3 More Cards button is pressed, either replace the selected cards if they are a match or add 3 cards to the game.
- Disable the Deal 3 More Cards button if there are no more cards in the Set deck or no more room in the UI to fit 3 more cards.
- Include a New Game button.
